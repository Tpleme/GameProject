Keep It Clean

This game was based in real life events.
We all have that friend that lives in the middle of chaos, and where the plates build up in the kitchen sink. By the way, we also love that friend. None the less, we are using this art of living as inspiration for our first game, and exaggerating things a bit. 
In times of social network, (and also, very difficult times of quarantine - Covid-19 anyone?), online dating increased exponentially. Using that concept associated with a very messy house, our main idea for this game was to arrange a date to our character and give him a purpose to clean his house - nobody wants to invite a date to a dirty place, are we right?

So, to help our character having a really nice Netflix and Chill evening, the player has to clean and organise character’s space. To win the game, and consequently the date, there are a number of tasks to be done in a period of short time. If not  you will lose your chances with BabyGirl, and for another Tinder match you will have to wait.

 
This is our first game, developed in two weeks, with no previous programming experience. Due to lack of time, there are some extras still to be added and enhanced.
Possible enhancements: 
- New levels, and image floors (different areas of the house);
- Different tasks to complete; 
- Other objects to interact to;
- Refine cat behaviour logic.
